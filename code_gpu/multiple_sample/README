********************** PUBLIC INFO **************************
# WHAT'S IN THESE FILES
utils.cpp contains useful functions; the file end with .cl 
contains parallel code for kernel; the other file end with
.cpp contains main function and some other functions for 
setting up OpenCL.

# HOW TO COMPILE:
In order to compile this code, devices with OpenCL 
https://www.khronos.org/opencl/ is needed. The library for 
OpenCL "libOpenCL.so" might not be in the same directory for
each machine, or might not have the same name. 
Therefore, you may need to set the path to the library file
in "makefile" by hand. i.e. first make sure the device supports
OpenCL, then find where the library is.

# HOW TO SET THE CODE APPROPRIATE TO YOUR MACHINE:
Apart from modifying "makefile", platform also need to be 
modified. This is done by searching for function 
"FindOpenCLPlatform" in sorce cpp code, in "SetupOpenCL" 
function. Function "FindOpenCLPlatform" has two variables,
the first is the name for platform. You may change it according
to your device.


********************** SPECIFIC INFO **************************
This piece of code is suitable for calculating the diffraction 
pattern for a thermalized nonideal sample. It will calculate 
the result for each configuration, and take the average as result. 
Liquids, glasses or thermalized crystals can use this code.

To generate a thermalized nonideal sample containing mutiple 
configurations, one need to conduct molecular dynamic simulation.

Input: config.xyz	supports multiple configurations
Output: Ixy.dat		with the form "x y Intensity"
Use 2d screen, supports forward & back reflection, supports
point scattering potentials only.


************************* INPUT *****************************
1. Input number of configurations_
  Number of configurations in the sample .xyz file.

Other input parameters similar to previous codes.
