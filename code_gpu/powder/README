********************** PUBLIC INFO **************************
# WHAT'S IN THESE FILES
utils.cpp contains useful functions; the file end with .cl 
contains parallel code for kernel; the other file end with
.cpp contains main function and some other functions for 
setting up OpenCL.

# HOW TO COMPILE:
In order to compile this code, devices with OpenCL 
https://www.khronos.org/opencl/ is needed. The library for 
OpenCL "libOpenCL.so" might not be in the same directory for
each machine, or might not have the same name. 
Therefore, you may need to set the path to the library file
in "makefile" by hand. i.e. first make sure the device supports
OpenCL, then find where the library is.

# HOW TO SET THE CODE APPROPRIATE TO YOUR MACHINE:
Apart from modifying "makefile", platform also need to be 
modified. This is done by searching for function 
"FindOpenCLPlatform" in sorce cpp code, in "SetupOpenCL" 
function. Function "FindOpenCLPlatform" has two variables,
the first is the name for platform. You may change it according
to your device.
