********************** PUBLIC INFO **************************
# WHAT'S IN THESE FILES
utils.cpp contains useful functions; the file end with .cl 
contains parallel code for kernel; the other file end with
.cpp contains main function and some other functions for 
setting up OpenCL.

# HOW TO COMPILE:
In order to compile this code, devices with OpenCL 
https://www.khronos.org/opencl/ is needed. The library for 
OpenCL "libOpenCL.so" might not be in the same directory for
each machine, or might not have the same name. 
Therefore, you may need to set the path to the library file
in "makefile" by hand. i.e. first make sure the device supports
OpenCL, then find where the library is.

# HOW TO SET THE CODE APPROPRIATE TO YOUR MACHINE:
Apart from modifying "makefile", platform also need to be 
modified. This is done by searching for function 
"FindOpenCLPlatform" in sorce cpp code, in "SetupOpenCL" 
function. Function "FindOpenCLPlatform" has two variables,
the first is the name for platform. You may change it according
to your device.


********************** SPECIFIC INFO **************************
Input: config.xyz	only supports single configuration
Output: Ixy.dat		with the form "x y Intensity"
Use 2d factor, only supports forward reflection, only supports
point scattering potentials

rotation along y axis


************************** INPUT *****************************
1. Input wavelength_
  Wavelength chosen for rotating the sample
2. Input number of particles_
  Number of particles in the sample.
3. Input Height_
4. Input D_
  Height for the screen, and distance between the sample and
  the screen (i.e. the radius for the cylinder), as shown in
  FIG.7 in THE PAPER.
5. rotation_increment
  Increment for rotation angle, in unit of degree.
6. rotation_range
  Range for rotation, in unit of degree. e.g. 360 for rotating
  the whole circle.
